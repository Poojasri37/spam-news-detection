# spam-news-detection
Overview
This project aims to build a machine learning model to classify news articles as either spam or legitimate. By leveraging a Streamlit-based web application, users can input news content and receive instant predictions on whether the content is likely spam or not.

Features
Data Analysis:

Comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify patterns in spam and legitimate news content.
Insights from text preprocessing, including word frequency analysis.
Machine Learning:

Implementation of text classification models.
Evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment of the best-performing model for real-time predictions.
User Interface:

Interactive web application using Streamlit.
User-friendly input fields for testing news content.
Visual feedback on classification results and confidence levels.
Technologies Used
Python: Core programming language.
Libraries:
Pandas, Numpy: Data preprocessing and manipulation.
NLTK, SpaCy: Natural language processing (NLP).
Scikit-learn: Model development and evaluation.
Streamlit: Web application framework for deployment.
Workflow
Data Collection:

Dataset of labeled news articles, with classes for spam and legitimate content, sourced from platforms like Kaggle.
Data Preprocessing:

Text cleaning (removal of special characters, stop words, and punctuation).
Tokenization and lemmatization.
Conversion to numerical format using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Model Development:

Training multiple machine learning models, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest.
Hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance.
Selecting the model with the best classification metrics.
Deployment with Streamlit:

Building an interactive interface for user input.
Displaying prediction results with visualizations.
